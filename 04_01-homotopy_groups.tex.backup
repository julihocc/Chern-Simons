\section{Homotopy groups of Lie groups}

\begin{defn}
Let $G$ be a connected compact Lie group. For any general compact group $G$ one can study its connected maximal abelian
subgroups. These are called \emph{maximal tori} and are conjugates of each other. The dimension of a maximal tori is
defined to be the \emph{rank} of $G$. The \emph{center} $Z$ of $G$ is the intersection of all maximal tori in $G$.
\end{defn}

We would like to describe the universal covering group $\til{G}$, and we need the following
\begin{lem}
 Let $G$ be a connected Lie group and $C$ be a discrete central subgroup of $G$ such that $G/C$ is compact. Then there
exists a compact neighbourhood $D$ of identity such that $\op{int}{D}\cdot C=G$ and $C$ is finitely generated.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
 Choose an open neighbourhood $U$ of $1\in G$, such that $\bar{U}$ is compact. Since the natural projection $P:G \to
G/C$ is open, $p(U)$ es an open neighbourhood of $1$ in $G/C$ and its translates by elements of $G/C$ cover $G/C$. By
the compactness of $G/C$, finitely many translates cover $G/C$. Choose preimages for these translates in $G$. say
$g_{1},...,g_{k}$, and set $D=\cup_{i} g_{i}\bar{U}$. This is a compact set and $G/C \subset p(\op{int}(D))$, and then
$G/C = p(\op{int}(D))$. Therefore, since for each $[g]\in G/C$ we can pick some $d\in \op{int}D$, such that $p(d)=[g]$,
we have $\op{int}D \cdot C= G$.

Let $D$ be as chosen before. Since $D^{2}$ is compact, it is contained in finitely many of translates of $D$ by
elements of $C,$ i.e.,
$$
D^{2} \subset \cup_{i=1}^{m} Dc_{i}.
$$
Then, for $\Gamma=\lan c_{1},...,c_{m} \ran$, we have $D^{2} \subset D \cdot \Gamma$. Using induction, we get $D^{n}
\subset D \cdot \Gamma.$ 
\end{proof}
