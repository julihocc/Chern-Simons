\section{The Bohm-Aharonov effect}

We have discussed above the effect of the geometry of the base space on the propieties of electromagnetic fields
defined on it. We now discuss a propierty of the electromagnetic field that depends on the topology of the base space.
In the last example (Dirac example) of the Dirac monopole we saw that the topology of the base space may require
several local gauge potentials to describe a single global gauge field. in fact, this is the general situation. 

In classical theory only the electromagnetic field was supposed to have physical significance while the potential was
regarded as a mathematical artifact. However, in topologically non-trivial spaces the potential also becomes physical
significant. For example,
